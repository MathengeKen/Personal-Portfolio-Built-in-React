# Description
This code-base depicts the creation of a personal portfolio using React and Material-UI.
Feel free to fork and alter it to your liking.

# Lessons Learnt
I learnt how to use React hooks such as useParams and useNavigate especially for the creation of custom routes.
I also got an introduction to the Material-UI library which allows for easier customization of the React components.

# Future Goals for the project
Placing a light/dark theme button.

# Kindly note
The GithubIcons, LinkedIcons and TwitterIcons do not lead anywhere. However, one can easily implement this as demonstrated in the ProjectDisplay.js file where the GithubIcon is anchored.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
